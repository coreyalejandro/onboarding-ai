              "Hi, I'm Corey. Welcome the AIMe: The AI + Me Collaboration Guide. This course is inspired by the first system prompt I ever built on my own from scratch

              There  is a plethora of good information out there that will teach how you to build  intelligent, self-iprovigmproduction-ready, enterprise agents and agentic systems. This course was designed to teach you what you need to know before you take courses.

              Attention Is All You Need" is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced the Transformer model, a neural network architecture that relies solely on a self-attention mechanism to process sequences. This concept proved foundational for the development of modern large language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Who would've thought that the most common command in childhood—Pay attention!—would revolutionize the modern world.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's within that same spirit that I created this course. Like it or not, when you're working with artificial intelligence, you're in a relationship. And as it goes in relationships, there are things we take for granted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of this course is to draw your attention to the things, the tiny things you do or don't do—the snippets of code, behavior and attitudes—that if given more attention, which is to say intent, you, in collaboration with AI, can transform your life and the life of others.
            </p>

              How do I know? I am 56 year old autistic, schizophrenic man with severe ADHD, OCD, and anxiety—enough disturbances to make the ground shake. However, working with AI has opened possibilities that even as professional daydreamer that even I didn't see coming. Like this course which I built from scratch in 3 days thanks to AI.

              AI +. me = AIme. Aim: to direct information, a product, or an action toward something, or Aim: A purpose or intention; a desired outcome: In this course we seek both.
